## Projects

#### Search Engine | Python, html/css, sqlite, GCP | [try it out](https://b5cq7vfzch.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/)

- I built a search engine that uses filtering to reorder results based on content and remove malicious/ad-heavy tracking websites.
- Engine will get results from the Google search API, store them in an SQL-lite database, then rank them based on defined filters.

#### Self-driving car | javascript, Neural Networks | [try it out](https://muzammil35.github.io/Self-driving-car/)

- Used my knowledge of Neural networks and Genetic algorithms to build a self-driving car that will learn to drive on a busy road.
- Car is controlled by a Neural Network that leverages a genetic algorithm
- Algorithm utilizes mutations derived from  most successful past trials, facilitating the generation of novel trial configurations 
  for enhanced learning and adaptability.
